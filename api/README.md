This directory contains three related pieces:

- `fastapi/`: the REST + GraphQL service
- `graphql-library/`: generated Python package for the GraphQL client
- `example-client/`: end-to-end workflow client that exercises the generated package

## Main Commands

Start or stop the FastAPI service:

```bash
make up MODE=docker
make up MODE=bare
make down MODE=docker
make down MODE=bare
```

Generate the GraphQL client library:

```bash
make library-generate MODE=docker
make library-generate MODE=bare
```

- `MODE=docker` builds and runs the generator in Docker and uses the remote schema.
- `MODE=bare` uses the local Python virtualenv and defaults to the local schema.

Run the end-to-end example client:

```bash
make run MODE=docker
make run MODE=bare
```

- `MODE=docker` runs the example client in a container.
- `MODE=bare` runs it locally and will regenerate the bare-mode library environment if it is missing.

## Generated Artifacts

The API area generates local state in these locations:

- `fastapi/.venv/`
- `fastapi/data/`
- `fastapi/runtime/`
- `fastapi/company.sqlite`
- `graphql-library/.venv/`
- `graphql-library/build/`
- `graphql-library/generated/`
- `graphql-library/dist/`
- `graphql-library/*.egg-info/`
- Python bytecode under `example-client/`, `fastapi/`, and `graphql-library/`

These paths are covered by the repository `.gitignore` files.

## Cleanup

Remove generated API artifacts:

```bash
make distclean
```

This delegates to:

- `fastapi/distclean`: removes runtime state, local DB, Docker data, and venv
- `graphql-library/distclean`: removes build output, generated package, dist output, egg-info, and venv
- `example-client/distclean`: removes Python cache artifacts
