## Playground for REST and GraphQL APIs

Most of the code was generated with the help of AI and Vibe Coding.
It creates a FastAPI API running on localhost:8000 which provides classic REST as well as GraphQL endpoints.
The GraphQL endpoints are then used the automagically generate a Python library. So any Python client can import the library and use the API endpoints without any further development. In addition Pytest test cases are automatically generated and executed.
Everything is Docker based so it can easily be deployed and used elsewhere.
One can easily use the code locally by using the following Make targets:
```
make
```
```
make example
```
```
make clean
make clean-all
```

### Vibe conding steps
```
i am a python rookie. generate simple plain easy to understand code which uses
an sqlite database named company.sqlite. the database includes a table named
employees. each entry consists of string 'name', string 'surname', string
'description', integer 'employee_id'.
```
```
code looks great. pleas add simple plain easy to understand fastapi code which
adds and entry to the employee table when REST API endpoint /employee is called
with POST. it returns all existing entries of table employee when /employee is
called with GET. The entry gets deleted when endpoint is called with DELETE.
Needs a function to update existing entries as well.
```
```
code looks great. pleas add simple plain easy to understand fastapi code which
adds graphql functionality in addition to the existing REST stuff
```
```
code looks great. but an update operation is missing in the graphql. 
please show the complete code
```
```
code looks great. use a more flexible approach in Query (Read) instead of rows)
please show the complete code
```
```
code looks great. can we pull the database connect parts into a centrailized
location so i would have to change it only once in case i wanted to use another
database like postgres in future instead of sqlite?
```
```
the code looks great. please add an initial entry to the employee table during
statup of the app
```

### Start
```
docker compose up --build
```

### Open
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
http://localhost:8000/graphql
```

### REST - GET all employees
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees
```

### REST - POST add employee
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "employee_id": 2,
    "name": "Alice",
    "surname": "Smith",
    "description": "Project Manager"
  }'
```

### REST - PUT update employee
```
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees/2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "employee_id": 2,
    "name": "Alice",
    "surname": "Smith",
    "description": "Senior Project Manager"
  }'

```

### REST - DELETE employee
```
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees/2
```

### GraphQL Query - Read employees
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query { employees { employeeId name surname description } }"
  }'
```

### GraphQL Mutation — Add Employee
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { addEmployee(employeeId: 3, name: \"Bob\", surname: \"Brown\", description: \"Developer\") }"
  }'
```

### GraphQL Mutation — Update Employee
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { updateEmployee(employeeId: 3, name: \"Bob\", surname: \"Brown\", description: \"Senior Developer\") }"
  }'
```

### GraphQL Mutation — Delete Employee
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { deleteEmployee(employeeId: 3) }"
  }'
```

### Use the Python library in a script:
```
rm -rf .venv/
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

unset SSL_CERT_FILE
unset REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE
unset CURL_CA_BUNDLE

pip3 install -U pip
pip3 install pydantic httpx

python3 example_client.py
```

### Install and use the Python library directly in CLI:
```
pip install -e .
employee-cli list

```
