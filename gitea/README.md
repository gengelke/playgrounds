# Local Gitea + 2 Runners (Docker or Bare)

This setup runs one local Gitea instance and attaches two action runners.
All first-run initialization is automatic.

## Modes

- `MODE=docker`: runs Gitea and both runners in Docker.
- `MODE=bare`: runs Gitea and both runners as local processes (no Docker).

## Quick start

```bash
make up MODE=docker
# or
make up MODE=bare
```

After startup, login credentials are printed to the CLI when they are auto-managed.

Stop:

```bash
make down MODE=docker
# or
make down MODE=bare
```

Logs:

```bash
make logs MODE=docker
# or
make logs MODE=bare
```

## Defaults you can override

```bash
GITEA_HTTP_PORT=3000
GITEA_SSH_PORT=2222
GITEA_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000/
GITEA_ADMIN_USER=admin
GITEA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
GITEA_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
GITEA_USER=myuser
GITEA_USER_PASSWORD=password
GITEA_USER_EMAIL=myuser@example.com
GITEA_AUTO_ADD_EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW=true
GITEA_EXAMPLE_REPO=actions-example
GITEA_REMOVE_EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW_REPO=false
GITEA_AUTO_ADD_JENKINS_EXAMPLE=true
GITEA_JENKINS_EXAMPLE_REPO=jenkins-example
GITEA_AUTO_ADD_GENERATE_LIBRARY=true
GITEA_GENERATE_LIBRARY_REPO=generate-library
GITEA_AUTO_ADD_LIBRARY_EXAMPLE_CLIENT=true
GITEA_LIBRARY_EXAMPLE_CLIENT_REPO=library-example-client
GITEA_AUTO_ADD_ADD_EMPLOYEE=true
GITEA_ADD_EMPLOYEE_REPO=add-employee
RUNNER1_NAME=agent-runner-1
RUNNER2_NAME=agent-runner-2
RUNNER_LABELS_DOCKER=linux-amd64:docker://node:20-bookworm
RUNNER_LABELS_BARE=linux-amd64:host
```

## Bare mode prerequisites

- `gitea` binary available in `PATH` (or set `GITEA_BIN=/path/to/gitea`)
- `act_runner` binary available in `PATH` (or set `ACT_RUNNER_BIN=/path/to/act_runner`)
- `curl`

## Notes

- Runtime data and generated config are stored in `./runtime/`.
- `make up` ensures both login users exist: `admin/password` and `myuser/password`.
- `make up` ensures a private `actions-example` repository exists by default and writes `.gitea/workflows/actions-example.yml`.
- The `actions-example` workflow prints `hello world` on push and manual dispatch.
- Optional: set `GITEA_REMOVE_EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW_REPO=true` to remove `actions-example` during bootstrap.
- `make up` also ensures a private repository (`jenkins-example`) exists for `myuser` with branch-specific `Jenkinsfile` content:
  - default branch (`main`/`master`): prints `hello prod world`
  - `dev` branch: prints `hello dev world`
- `make up` also ensures a private repository (`generate-library`) exists for `myuser` with the managed `Jenkinsfile` on its default and `dev` branches:
  - checks out the configured generate-library source repo (default `https://github.com/gengelke/playground.git`)
  - uses the configured generate-library source branch, defaulting to the job branch
  - runs `make library-generate MODE=bare LIBRARY_SCHEMA_SOURCE=local` in `api/`
  - builds and uploads the `fastapi-graphql-client` package from `api/graphql-library` to the Nexus PyPI repo `pypi-public`
- `make up` also ensures a private repository (`library-example-client`) exists for `myuser` with the managed `Jenkinsfile` on its default and `dev` branches:
  - checks out the configured library-example-client source repo (default `https://github.com/gengelke/playground.git`)
  - starts the FastAPI service in bare mode
  - installs `fastapi-graphql-client` from the Nexus PyPI repo `pypi-public`
  - runs `api/example-client/company.py workflow` using the installed package
- `make up` also ensures a private repository (`add-employee`) exists for `myuser` with the managed `Jenkinsfile` on its default and `dev` branches:
  - checks out the configured add-employee source repo (default `https://github.com/gengelke/playground.git`)
  - installs `fastapi-graphql-client` from the Nexus PyPI repo `pypi-public`
  - uses the configured shared FastAPI instance for both the Jenkins role dropdown and the GraphQL mutation call
  - calls `api/example-client/company.py add-employee --employee-name ... --employee-surname ... --employee-role ...`
  - is meant to be used from Jenkins with build parameters `EMPLOYEE_NAME`, `EMPLOYEE_SURNAME`, and a role dropdown backed by the FastAPI `GET /roles` API
- The runner registration token is generated directly from Gitea during bootstrap, persisted in `runtime/shared/generated.env`, and synced to Vault.
- In bare mode, runners are registered once and persisted under `runtime/bare/runner1` and `runtime/bare/runner2`.
- Bootstrap values/secrets are persisted in `runtime/shared/generated.env`.
- If `../vault/.vault/credentials.env` is available and Vault is reachable, credentials are also synced to `secret/data/services/gitea`.

## Cleanup

```bash
make distclean
```

`distclean` removes `runtime/` and `.gitea/`.
